# Color-Image-Segmentation-using-Modified-Kmeans
Color image is segmented by applying Modified Kmeans algorithm which avoids dependancy on initial K value.
3 different images are taken as example and we can see in the output that the algorithm segments the image appropriately without initial K value.
